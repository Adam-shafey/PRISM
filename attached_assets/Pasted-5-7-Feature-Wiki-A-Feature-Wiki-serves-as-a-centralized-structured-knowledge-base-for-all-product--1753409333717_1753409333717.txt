5.7. Feature Wiki
A Feature Wiki serves as a centralized, structured knowledge base for all product features, both current and past. It's crucial for maintaining a single source of truth, enabling efficient onboarding of new team members, providing historical context for product decisions, and ensuring that product knowledge is easily accessible across the organization. By documenting features comprehensively, teams can avoid re-solving old problems, understand dependencies, and communicate product capabilities effectively.

Feature Page Creation:

Ability to create a new feature page, either from scratch or by converting a "Prioritized" idea from the Ideas & Problems module.

Standardized Template: Each feature page will follow a customizable template (e.g., sections for Problem Statement, Solution Overview, User Stories/Requirements, Technical Considerations, Design Mockups/Links, Key Metrics, Release Notes, Learnings).

AI-Assisted Content Generation: The system will suggest relevant content or auto-fill sections of a new feature page using AI, based on data from linked ideas, insights, and validation results (mocked initially).

Content Management:

Rich text editor for detailed descriptions within each section.

Ability to embed/link various media types (images, videos, documents, external URLs).

Internal Linking: Ability to link to other feature pages, ideas, insights, or validation records within PRISM.

Versioning & History:

Automatic versioning of feature pages, allowing users to view previous versions and track changes.

Ability to compare different versions.

Search & Navigation:

Dedicated search functionality within the Wiki to find features by name, keywords, or content.

Categorization and tagging for easy browsing.

Collaboration:

Commenting functionality on feature pages.

@mentions to notify team members.

Status & Lifecycle:

Define a lifecycle status for each feature (e.g., "Draft," "Active," "Deprecated," "Archived").

Linking to Other Modules:

Direct links from Feature Wiki pages back to their originating Idea/Problem, associated Insights, and Validation efforts.
