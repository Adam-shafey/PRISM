5.6. Team Management & Role-Based Permissions
This module provides administrators with the ability to create and manage teams, assign users to these teams, and define granular permissions that control user access and capabilities across the PRISM Product Discovery App's modules. This ensures secure collaboration and appropriate data access for different roles within the product organization.

User Assignment: Ability to add or remove existing users from specific teams. A user can belong to multiple teams.

Role Definition & Assignment:

Pre-defined Roles: The system will come with a set of pre-defined roles (e.g., Administrator, Product Manager, Contributor, Viewer).

Role Assignment: Administrators can assign a specific role to each user within each team. A user's effective permissions are the sum of permissions from all teams they belong to.
