Product Requirements Document: PRISM Product Discovery App
Version: 1.1
Date: July 24, 2025
Author: Gemini

1. Introduction / Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for the PRISM Product Discovery App, a new module within the broader PRISM platform. PRISM is designed to be a comprehensive platform for product discovery, planning, and monitoring/analytics. This initial app will focus specifically on the product discovery phase, providing product teams with tools to systematically capture, validate, analyze, and prioritize new product ideas and opportunities.

The PRISM Product Discovery App aims to centralize insights from various sources, facilitate structured problem validation, and enable intelligent analysis and data-driven decision-making early in the product lifecycle through the strategic application of AI. It will serve as the foundational layer for identifying high-potential initiatives that can then flow into the planning and monitoring modules of the PRISM platform.

2. Goals
2.1. Primary Goal
To provide product teams with a centralized, structured, and data-informed environment for capturing, validating, and prioritizing product ideas and problems.

2.2. Secondary Goals
Streamline Idea Capture: Offer intuitive ways for users to submit, enrich, and categorize new product ideas or identified problems.

Facilitate Problem Validation: Enable teams to systematically validate identified problems through user research, data analysis, and market insights.

Centralize Insights: Aggregate qualitative and quantitative data from various sources (user interviews, surveys, analytics, competitive analysis) to support discovery.

Improve Prioritization: Provide tools and frameworks to help teams objectively assess and prioritize opportunities based on validated problems and potential impact.

Enhance Collaboration: Foster cross-functional collaboration during the discovery process.

Leverage AI for Intelligent Analysis: Automate aspects of data processing, summarization, and suggestion to accelerate discovery.

Seamless Handoff: Create a clear pathway for validated opportunities to transition into the product planning phase within the PRISM platform.

3. Target Audience
Product Managers: Primary users for capturing ideas, conducting validation, and prioritizing opportunities.

Product Designers/UX Researchers: Users for contributing user insights, research findings, and validating problem spaces.

Engineers: Users for providing technical feasibility input and understanding problem contexts.

Business Stakeholders/Leadership: Users for reviewing product opportunities, understanding strategic alignment, and providing feedback.

4. User Stories
4.1. Idea & Problem Capture
As a Product Manager, I want to quickly capture new product ideas or identified problems, so that no potential opportunity is lost.

As a Product Manager, I want to categorize ideas/problems by theme, product area, or strategic pillar, so that I can easily organize and retrieve them.

As a Product Manager, I want the system to suggest relevant categories or tags for new ideas using AI, so that I can quickly and consistently classify them.

As a Product Manager, I want to add detailed descriptions, initial hypotheses, and relevant context to each idea/problem, so that others can understand its scope and potential.

4.2. Insight Aggregation
As a Product Manager, I want to link user research notes, survey results, and analytics data to specific ideas/problems, so that all relevant insights are centralized for validation.

As a Product Manager, I want to upload or link competitive analysis documents and market trend reports, so that I can understand the external landscape for an idea.

As a Product Manager, I want the system to automatically summarize key takeaways from linked documents or user feedback using AI, so that I can quickly grasp core insights.

As a Product Manager, I want to add qualitative feedback from customer interviews directly to an idea/problem, so that user voices are directly tied to potential solutions.

4.3. Problem Validation & Analysis
As a Product Manager, I want to define and track validation hypotheses for each problem/idea, so that I can systematically prove or disprove assumptions.

As a Product Manager, I want to record the results of validation experiments (e.g., A/B tests, prototypes), so that I have clear evidence for decision-making.

As a Product Manager, I want to collaborate with teammates on analyzing insights and validation results, so that we can collectively build a shared understanding.

4.4. Opportunity Prioritization
As a Product Manager, I want to assign a score or priority level to each validated opportunity (e.g., using RICE, ICE, or custom scoring), so that I can objectively compare and rank them.

As a Product Manager, I want the system to suggest initial prioritization scores (e.g., Impact, Effort, Confidence) based on aggregated data and insights using AI, so that I have a data-informed starting point for evaluation.

As a Product Manager, I want to visualize opportunities in a prioritization matrix (e.g., effort vs. impact), so that I can easily identify high-value initiatives.

As a Product Manager, I want to mark an opportunity as "ready for planning," so that it can seamlessly transition to the PRISM Planning module.
